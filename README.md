# Tic-Tac-Toe-in-C-Player-vs-AI-Unbeatable-
The Tic-Tac-Toe Game with AI in C is a console-based project where the player uses ‘X’ and the computer uses ‘O’. It includes an unbeatable AI built using the Minimax algorithm, which always chooses the best move. The project teaches arrays, functions, loops, recursion, and basic AI decision-making in a simple game format.
